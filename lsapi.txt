# 2.1 Defining API
## 2.1.1 What is an API?

An API, or Application Programming Interface, provide a way for computer systems to interact with each other. There are many types of APIs. Every programming language has a built-in API that it used to write programs. Mobile devices provide APIs to provide access to location or other sensor data, such as the device's GPS location or the orientation of the device. Operating systems themselves have APIs used by programs to open files, access memory, and draw text on the screen. While the types of uses for APIs are vast, the one thing all APIs have in commons is **providing functionality for use by another program**.
